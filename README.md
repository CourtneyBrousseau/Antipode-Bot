# @AntipodeBot

This is a remix of random-image-twitterbot. This twitter bot generates random coordinates that are exactly opposite on ðŸŒŽ, also known as antipodes and then uses the Google Maps API to tweet the names and photos of those locations. You can check out the results [@AntipodeBot](https://www.twitter.com/AntipodeBot).
